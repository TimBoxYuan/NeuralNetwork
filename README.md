# NeuralNetwork

Universal Approximation THM basically states that all continous fuction from R -> R can be approximated by a
one hidden layer neural network. 

The Universal_Approx_Obj.py and the Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the Universal Approximation THM

The Universal_Approx_Obj.py contains the Universal Approxiamtion objective and examples
